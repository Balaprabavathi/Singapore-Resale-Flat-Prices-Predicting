# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
This project leverages machine learning to predict copper selling prices (regression) and lead outcomes (classification) using optimized models and preprocessing techniques. An interactive Streamlit app allows users to input data and get predictions seamlessly.
# Industrial Copper Modeling
This project addresses challenges in the copper manufacturing industry by building machine learning models for pricing prediction (regression) and lead classification (classification). The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model optimization, and a user-friendly Streamlit application for predictions.

# Problem Statement
The copper industry faces challenges with skewed and noisy sales data, making manual predictions inaccurate and time-consuming. This project aims to:
- Develop a regression model to predict selling prices based on product attributes.
- Build a classification model to predict lead status (WON/LOST).
- Create an interactive application to make predictions using real-time input data.

## Skills and Tools Used
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
## Techniques:
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, outlier removal, normalization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression and Classification Modeling
- Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning
